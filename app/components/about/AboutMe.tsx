                    I starting programming some time around the end of 2018 and since then, programming has been my biggest hobby. I try to always have some project going, something to work on whenever I have the time.

                            Since 2015, back in secondary school, I&apos;ve been a huge fan of the incremental game <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a>. There&apos;s something uniquely satisfying about watching numbers climb higher and higher. Before long, I wanted to create my own incremental gameâ€”but at the time, I knew nothing about programming. It felt intimidating, almost impossible, like something I&apos;d never be able to do. It took a few years before I finally decided I just had to give it a shot.

                            In 2018, I created my very first game: <Link to="/tree-cutter">Tree Cutter</Link>, an incremental game about, well, cutting trees. I poured countless hours into it, constantly experimenting with new CSS tricks, discovering how to generate HTML programmatically with JavaScript, and pretty much Googling everything I didn&apos;t understand. It was a messy, unpolished project, but it taught me so much about programming.
                        </p>
                        <p className="normal-text about-me-section">
                            I never did finish Tree Cutter, but making it was a turning point. It showed me that the best way to learn coding isn&apos;t through books or tutorialsâ€”it&apos;s by *building* things. The only true way to become a programmer is to set a goal and then figure out whatever it takes to achieve it.

                            My passion for incremental games never faded. Six years later, I&apos;m working on a new project: <Link to="/emoji-tycoon">Emoji Tycoon</Link>. This time, with the experience I&apos;ve gained, I&apos;m aiming to build a fully-realized mobile game, complete with a robust front-end and back-end. I&apos;m planning to publish it by the end of 2024â€”unless life throws some unexpected curveballs! ðŸ˜Š
